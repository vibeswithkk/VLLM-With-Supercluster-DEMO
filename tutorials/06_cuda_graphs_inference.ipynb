    "# CUDA Graphs for Inference Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores CUDA graphs, a powerful optimization technique used in modern inference engines to reduce kernel launch overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are CUDA Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA graphs allow you to capture a sequence of CUDA operations (kernel launches, memory copies, etc.) into a graph object that can be executed repeatedly with much lower overhead than launching the same operations individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are CUDA Graphs Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "In inference workloads, the same sequence of operations is often repeated many times with the same structure but different data. Traditional kernel launches have significant overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CPU overhead**: Each kernel launch requires CPU cycles to set up the launch\n",
    "2. **Synchronization overhead**: CPU-GPU synchronization for each launch\n",
    "3. **Driver overhead**: CUDA driver calls for each operation\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA graphs eliminate most of this overhead by capturing the operations once and re-executing the pre-optimized graph."
