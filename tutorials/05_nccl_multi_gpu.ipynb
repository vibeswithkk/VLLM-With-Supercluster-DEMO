    "# Distributed Computing for LLM Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores distributed computing concepts essential for scaling large language model inference across multiple GPUs and nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Distributed Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed computing involves breaking down computational tasks across multiple processors, computers, or GPUs to achieve better performance, handle larger datasets, and improve fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of LLM inference:\n",
    "1. **Model Parallelism**: Distribute model parameters across multiple devices\n",
    "2. **Data Parallelism**: Process multiple inputs simultaneously across devices\n",
    "3. **Pipeline Parallelism**: Split model layers across devices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Distributed Computing Important for LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs have billions of parameters that often exceed the memory capacity of a single GPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Constraints**: Single GPUs have limited memory (16-80GB)\n",
    "2. **Performance Requirements**: Need to process large batches efficiently\n",
    "3. **Cost Efficiency**: Better utilization of available hardware\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Ability to grow with model size and throughput requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Distributed Computing\n",

    "### Collective Communications\n",
    "\n",
    "Collective communications are operations that involve all processes in a communicator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AllReduce**: Combine data from all processes and distribute the result\n",
    "2. **AllToAll**: Each process sends distinct data to every other process\n",
    "3. **Broadcast**: Send data from one process to all others\n",
    "4. **Reduce**: Combine data from all processes to one process\n",
